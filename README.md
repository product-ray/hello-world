# hello-world 
i'm a non-technical product manager working in fintech, and i am inundated with ideas that i can't bring to life because i can't code. 
this is an effort to change that.

i've always been the idea guy which lends itself well to product management, and as i come up on a year out of college, i've learned a lot about executing on those ideas.
as i was reading the github documentation, i learned that i could use this hello-world repo like a blog, and i'd been thinking of starting a substack, so i'll use this instead. 

my goal is to become a product engineer that can take a project from idea to v1
my plan is to make mvps for my ideas at the moment & learn to code while doing it while leveraging ai throughout the process

i'll document my journey here, along with my other musings as i navigate a new career and my infinite passion projects 

cheers to what i'm sure will be an interesting journey
